# Iteration

**Learning objectives:**

- **Reduce duplication** in code by **iterating** over a pattern using a **`for` loop.**
- **Modify an object** using a **`for` loop.**
- Recognize the **three basic ways** to **loop over a vector** using a **`for` loop.**
- Handle **unknown output lengths** by using a **more complex result** and then **combining** the result after the **`for` loop.**
- Handle **unknown sequence lengths** with a **`while` loop.**
- **Reduce duplication** in code by passing a function as an argument to a function **(functional programming).**
- Make iteration code **easier to read** with the **`map` family** of functions from **`{purrr}`.**
- Make `map` code **faster to type** with **shortcuts.**
- **Compare** the **`map` family** of functions to the base R **`apply` family.**
- **Deal with errors** and other output using the **`{purrr}` adverbs: `safely`, `possibly`, and `quietly`.**
- Map over **multiple arguments** with the **`map2` family** and the **`pmap` family** from `{purrr}`.
- Map over **multiple functions** with the **`invoke_map` family** from `{purrr}` and its replacements (see `?purrr::invoke_map`, "Life cycle").
- Call a function for its **side effects** using the **`walk`** family of functions from `{purrr}`.
- Recognize the **other iteration functions** from `{purrr}`.

## 21.1 Intro

**Good iteration - Pre-allocate the shape/structure and then fill in the data**.

**Imperative programming** - `for` loops and `while` loops make iteration very explicit.

**Functional programming** - common `for` loop patterns get their own functions, so you can streamline your code even more.

Packages: `library(tidyverse)`, `library(purrr)`

## 21.2 For loops

Each loop has three components:

-   **output** - Allocate enough space for your `for` loop. A loop that grows at each iteration will be very "slow".

-   **sequence** - What to loop over.

    -   `seq_along()` is a safe version of the familiar `1:length(x)`: if you have a zero-length vector, it will tell you.

-   **body** - This is the code that does the work.

## 21.3 For loop variations

There are four variations on the basic theme of the `for` loop:

1.  Modifying an existing object, instead of creating a new object.

2.  Looping over names or values, instead of indices.

    -   There are three basic ways to loop over a vector.

        -   `for (i in seq_along(df))`

        -   `for (x in xs)` - good for **side-effects**

        -   `for (nm in names(xs))` - creates name to access value with `x[[nm]]`

3.  Handling outputs of unknown length.

    -   `unlist()` flattens a list of vectors into a single vector,

    -   `purrr::flatten_dbl()` is stricter --- it will throw an error if the input isn't a list of doubles.

4.  Handling sequences of unknown length.

    -   Use a `while` loop.

## 21.4 For loops vs. functionals

`For` loops are not as important in R as they are in other languages because R is a functional programming language.

This means that it's possible to put `for` loops in a function, and call that function instead of using the `for` loop directly.

Base R and the `purrr` package have functions for many common loops.

## 21.5 The map functions

-   `map(.x, .f, ...)` makes a list.

-   `map_lgl(.x, .f, ...)` makes a logical vector.

-   `map_int(.x, .f, ...)` makes an integer vector.

-   `map_dbl(.x, .f, ...)` makes a double vector.

-   `map_chr(.x, .f, ...)` makes a character vector.

**Shortcuts with `purrr`:**

-   a one-sided formula creates an anonymous function

-   use a string to extract named components

-   Use an integer to select elements by position

**Base R:**

-   `lapply(X, FUN, ...)` makes a list (`map` is more consistent)

-   `sapply(X, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE, USE.NAMES = TRUE)` wrapper around `lapply`

-   `vapply(X, FUN, FUN.VALUE, ..., USE.NAMES = TRUE)` safe alternative to `sapply`, can make a matix

## 21.6 Dealing with failure

`safely()` - designed to work with `map`

-   `result` is the original result. If there was an error, this will be `NULL`.

-   `error` is an error object. If the operation was successful, this will be `NULL`.

`possibly()` - you give it a default value to return when there is an error.

`quietly()` - instead of capturing errors, it captures printed output, messages, and warnings.

## 21.7 Mapping over multiple arguments

`map2()` and `pmap()` functions are for multiple related inputs that you need iterate along in parallel.

**Invoking different functions**

*Read the help in purrr on these functons. If you need to do this read Advanced R. `invoke_map` is retired.*

## 21.8 Walk

`walk()` is an alternative to `map()` that you use when you want to call a function for its side effects, rather than for its return value.

`walk2` and `pwalk` - more useful than `walk`.

## 21.9 Other patterns of for loops

**Predicate functions -** return `TRUE` or `FALSE`

-   `keep` and `discard` - keep elements are `TRUE` and discard are `FALSE`.

-   `some` and `every` - determine if `TRUE` for any (some) or all (every)

-   `detect` and `detect_index` - detect finds first element where `TRUE`, and detect_index returns the position

-   `head_while()` and `tail_while()` - while `TRUE` take elements from start (head_while) or end (tail_while)

**Reduce and accumulate**

-   `reduce()` takes a "binary" function, applies it repeatedly to a list until there is only a single element left.

-   `accumulate()` keeps all the interim results.
