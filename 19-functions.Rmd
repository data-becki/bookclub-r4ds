# Functions

**Learning objectives:**

-   Write **functions** to **automate common tasks** in R.

    -   **Name** R functions using **consistent rules.**
    -   Effectively **use comments** in R functions to **explain the "why"** of your code.

-   **Conditionally execute code** in R functions.

    -   Use **`if`** and **`else`** statements to conditionally execute R code.
    -   Use **`switch`** statements to conditionally execute R code.
    -   Use **`cut`** to **discretize continuous variables.**

-   Use **consistent argument**s for R functions.

    -   Give **default values** to arguments in R functions.
    -   **Check values** of arguments to make safer functions in R.
    -   Use **`...` arguments** in R functions.

-   **Return** values from R functions.

    -   Use **explicit `return`s** to **return early** from an R function.
    -   Use **`invisible`** to **invisibly return values** from R functions.

-   Recognize how R utilizes **environments** and **lexical scoping** to find the value associated with a name.

# 19.1 Introduction

Functions are handy because:

-   they automate repetitive tasks.

-   have a name that makes the purpose very clear

-   you only need to update the code in one place as things change

-   it's safer than copy and paste - you won't replicate errors

The common theme for functions is to be consistent.

# 19.2 **When and how to write a function**

Have you copy and pasted code more than 2x? Consider a function!

Key steps in creating a function:

1.  Pick a **name** than makes it clear what the function does

2.  **Arguments**, or inputs, go inside `function`, like so `function(arguments)`.

3.  The **code** goes inside curly braces `{ }`, after `function()`.

4.  Check your function with a few inputs to make sure it's working.

# 19.3 Functions are for computers *and* humans

Be consistent in you naming and coding of functions

**Names:**

Functions should be verbs (action, state, or occurrence), arguments should be nouns (people places or things).

Be consistent in using snake_case or camelCase.

For sets of functions, use a common prefix

Don't overwrite existing function

**Comments:**

Use comments to explain the 'why' of the code

Use lines of - or = to break up code into sections

# 19.4 Conditional execution

`if` statements conditionally execute code. The condition must evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

Be careful: **`==`** is vectorised.

Use \|\| (OR) and && (AND) to combine multiple logical expressions.

You can string multiple if statements together: `if`, `else if`, `else`

For a long series of chained if statements, use `switch()`

Use `cut()` to 'discretise continuous variables'

**Format:**

Your function or `if` statement followed by a curly brace

New line, indent 2 spaces.

Ending brace on its own line, unless followed by else.

# 19.5 Function arguments

One set supplies the **data** to compute on

One set supplies arguments that control the **details** of the computation.

Generally, data comes first, and details go on the end and usually have default values.

Choose names that are longer and descriptive or use common ones:

-   x, y, z: vectors

-   w: a vector of weights

-   df: a data frame

-   i, j: numeric indices (rows/columns)

-   n: length, or number of rows

-   p: number of columns

Put checks in your functions to make constraints explicit.

Use `â€¦` as an argument that takes an arbitrary number of values

Lazy evaluation - arguments in R are not computed until they're needed.

# 19.6 Return values

Two things to consider when returning a value:

1.  Does returning early make your function easier to read?

> R, by default, returns the last value of a function. You can return a value with or without an explicit return statement.

2.  Can you make your function pipeable?

> There are two basic types of pipeable functions:
>
> -   With **transformations**, an object is passed to the function's first argument and a modified object is returned.
>
> -   With **side-effects**, the passed object is not transformed. Instead, the function performs an action on the object, like drawing a plot or saving a file.

# 19.7 Environment

**Lexical scoping** - R will look outside the function, in the environment, for definitions of variables, if it is not defined within.
